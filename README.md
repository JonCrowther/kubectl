## Adding new versions

The source for the versions to create the images is in `versions.txt`. You can manually add entries to it or use the [GitHub Actions workflow](./.github/workflows/add-new-versions.yml) to automatically lookup new versions and create a pull request.

Scripts live in the `./scripts` directory:

- `add-new-versions.sh`: Checks GitHub releases for `kubernetes/kubernetes` with a version regex, checks if the image already exists, and if not, adds it to `versions.txt`.
- `check-versions.sh`: Checks if the binaries exists for all architectures for versions in `versions.txt`.
- `image-build-and-push.sh`: Checks if image already exists, if not, build and push it.
- `manifest-create-and-push.sh`: After all images for all architectures are created, create a manifest for all architectures and push.
